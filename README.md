## üìö Quick Start

### Installation

#### Using NuGet (Recommended)
```bash
Install-Package PS4RemotePlayInterceptor
```

#### From Source
1. Clone this repository
2. Build the solution in Visual Studio 2022+
3. Reference `PS4RemotePlayInterceptor.dll` in your project

### Basic Example

```csharp
using PS4RemotePlayInterceptor;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Setup callback to interceptor
        Interceptor.Callback = new InterceptionDelegate(OnReceiveData);
        
        // Emulate controller (BETA) - use without physical DualShock 4
        Interceptor.EmulateController = false;
        
        // Start watchdog to automatically inject when possible
        Interceptor.Watchdog.Start();
        
        // Notify watchdog events
        Interceptor.Watchdog.OnInjectionSuccess = () => Console.WriteLine("‚úÖ Injection successful!");
        Interceptor.Watchdog.OnInjectionFailure = () => Console.WriteLine("‚ùå Injection failed");
        
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
    
    private static void OnReceiveData(ref DualShockState state)
    {
        // Modify the controller state here
        
        // Example: Auto-press X button
        state.Cross = true;
        
        // Example: Move left stick upward
        state.LY = 0;  // 0 = up, 128 = center, 255 = down
        
        // Example: Center both analog sticks
        // state.LX = 128;
        // state.LY = 128;
        // state.RX = 128;
        // state.RY = 128;
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: `STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR: Unknown error in injected C++ completion routine. (Code: 15)`**
- **Solution**: Restart PS4 Remote Play application

**Error: `Injection IPC failed (on some machines)`**
- **Solution**: Use compatibility mode
```csharp
Interceptor.InjectionMode = InjectionMode.Compatibility;
Interceptor.Inject();
```

**Controller not responding after injection**
- Ensure Remote Play is focused and connected to console
- Try unplugging and replugging your DualShock 4
- Enable `EmulateController` mode if using without physical controller
